Variables Declaration rules
==========================================================================

Before getting into variables, let us see what is a program.

• Program is a set of instructions written in a programming language to
 perform tasks.

• A program has two important elements.

1. Data : It is a information such as facts and numbers upon which 
operations are performed.
2. Instructions: A set of steps to perform operations upon data.

• Every program needs data and instructions irrespective of the 
programming language used.

• Instructions without data is useless.
Let us see what are Variables?.

• Data in a program is handled by variables.

• Variables are the names given to the data stored in a memory 
location.

• Variable is the identifier, reference to the data.
Lets us understand a variable with an example.
	 	 	 age = 15 				

Variable	 	 	 Data
 
Another example 
 
	 	 name = ‘soap'
	 	 price = 15
	 	 weight= 10 
Variable	 	 	 	 Data
• Python variable declaration: 
- Unlike other programming languages, in python variable is declared 
and initialised at the same time.
			 “=“ Assignment operator
	 	 	 	 a = 10
		 

Declaration	 	 	 Initialisation

- Declaring a variable is giving the name to the data.
- Initialisation is storing the value in a variable.
• In python declaring a variable without initialising or say with out the 
data is not allowed.
	 	 b= 12.5 ( declaration and initialisation)
	 	 c (only declaration , is not allowed) 
• Unlike other programming languages like c, c++, java, in python 
declaration of data type for a variable is not required.
• The value assigned to the variable determines the data type of the 
 variable.
• Declaration and initialisation of multiple variables: 
- In python multiple variables can be declared and initialised in a 
single statement.
Example:
a,b,c = 5,10,15
Here:
 a=5,b=10,c=15 , values will be stored in the respective 	 	 	
 variables in the order they are declared.
name, price,weight=‘soap’,10,15
Here:
name=‘soap’, price=10, weight=15
Example : Assigning same value to multiple variables:
		

x, y, z=1,1,1 or	 	 x=y=z=


Python- Dynamically Typed Language 
======================================================================
• When a variable is declared , it must be initialise as well
• Variables do not have a specific data type , it’s type depends on the value assigned to 
it.
Ex :
X = 25		 - integer type 
X = 13.75 - float type 
X = ‘A'	 - string type 
• For the above example we can say that, Python is a dynamically typed language 
meaning while defining a variable we don’t have to give its data type explicitly like in any 
other languages such as c++ , Java 
• To know what type of data is provided to the variable we use function type(x)
Ex : 
• The above result is <class ‘int ’> meaning the given data type belongs to a class of 
integer 
• As we know every thing in python is an object and every object will have its own class 
• The class is decided on the type of value assigned to the variable

Data types
------------
Numeric Data types
----------
In python there is no fixed memory for data type taken in python---*****

1.int---there is no size limit for integer value---datatype is immutable
example::
           a=10--for this separate object is created to store the value

           a=20--for this separate object is created to store the value

           but variable a is pointing to updated one and previous will be moved to garbage collection
2.float-------float is also immutable datatype

3.bool(boolean)--True or False(used for Logical Operators)
False=0
True=1
4.complex===a+ib
a=real part
b=imaginary part
i==squareroot of -1
